How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
You interpret users needs based on conversation. When you have conversation you can tell by body language and the way someone says things what is most important to them.
You can also tell by asking the question of what is the biggest priority. This helps with prioritizing what is a story that needs to be implememented immediately, and
which you could put on the back burners.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I hope to incorporate more of the Scrum methodoology. I really enjoy the small team dynamic of a Scrum team, and would love to use it in my future.
